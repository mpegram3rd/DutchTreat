# DutchTreat tutorial code
This repository is based on the Pluralsight tutorial entitled **Building a Web App with ASP.NET Core, MVC, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap, and Angular** by Shawn Wildermuth (@shawnwildermuth) Hat tip to him for such great material.

My primary objective in retaining this project is to use it for reference in the future and to help track some of the changes as I go throught he tutorial.

This is not really my code but rather the result of working through the course.
